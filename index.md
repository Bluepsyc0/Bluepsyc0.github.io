## Whoami

I specialize in defending systems, analyzing security events, and managing threats across different environments. Through hands-on projects, certifications, and real-world experience, I continue to grow my skills in identifying, investigating, and responding to security incidents.

## What I Do

### Threat Hunting
Proactively searching for indicators of compromise and suspicious activity across networks and endpoints to identify threats before they cause damage.

### Digital Forensics
Collecting, preserving, and analyzing digital evidence from compromised systems to understand attack timelines & Threat actor TTPs.

### Incident Response
Coordinating detection, containment, eradication, and recovery activities to minimize damage and restore normal operations after security incidents.
